This Java program is based on the thesis
<a target="_blank" href="https://dr.library.brocku.ca/handle/10464/15405">
    Optimal Quaternary Hermitian Linear Complementary Dual Codes for
    Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Error Correction
</a> created from scratch by
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maysara-al-jumaily/">
